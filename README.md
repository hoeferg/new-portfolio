## Description

This react web application is a portfollio of Gayle Hoefer's work. It includes an about me, portfolio, resume, and contact me section. This web application is meant to allow future employers to see what work Gayle has completed. 


### Future Development

This application will eventually host all my projects, but with pagination to avoid a cluttered screen.

## Deployed Application

This application is not deployed yet as it is still being created. Once the new portfolio is created, the link will be posted here.
