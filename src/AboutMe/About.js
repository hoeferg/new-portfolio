            <h2>About Gayle</h2>
            <p>I am a creative person who loves taking on challenges to keep learning and growing. My first challenge was
                teaching middle school science. It was wonderful to work with kids but after two years, I found that teaching
                was not the career for me.</p>

            <p>I then decided to go to University of Arizona Coding Boot camp. From this boot camp I learn JavaScript, react
                and many other skills. I continued to grow these skills by learning typescript and Java. I continue to learn
                by creating new projects and applying my knowledge in these three sections.</p>
